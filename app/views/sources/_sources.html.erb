    <p>Forest Monitoring for Action (FORMA) is a system for identifying near real-time forest change across the tropics, developed by researchers Dan Hammer, Robin Kraft, and David Wheeler. FORMA uses imagery from the MODIS Terra satellite to assess forest disturbance through time series analysis of vegetation intensity (NDVI) and other factors at 500m resolution. FORMA forest clearing alerts are produced every 16-days, and are compiled on the GFW 2.0 platform as monthly alerts. FORMA is a project of World Resources Institute and was developed at the Center for Global Development.</p>

    <p>Logging in Cameroon’s forests is permitted within Forest Management Units (FMUs). This dataset displays the FMUs within Cameroon’s permanent forest estate. There are 114 FMUs in Cameroon which are further divided into logging concessions called annual allowable cuts (AACs), where selective logging is permitted. These logging permits require owners and operators to maintain permanent forest cover. This dataset, released in 2012, was produced in a collaboration between the Cameroon Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife and WRI. For more information and datasets, see the <a href="http://www.wri.org/project/interactive-forest-atlas-cameroon">Cameroon Forest Atlas</a>.</p>

    <p>This data layer shows the boundaries of agro-industrial zones, where oil palm and rubber tree plantations, as well as other crops, may be established. In Cameroon, industrial agriculture falls outside of the National Forest Estate. Agricultural plantations are allocated by the Ministry of Economy and Planning to private entitities under long-term, renewable contracts, which are then monitored by the Ministry of Agriculture. The agro-industrial dataset was mapped using satellite imagery, with ground-truthing to determine the crop type and operating company. Official documentation was often lacking, so boundaries should be considered approximate and are not exhaustive.</p>

    <p>The Intact Forest Landscapes dataset identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of current forest extent (as of 2000), mapped from Landsat satellite imagery. These landscapes show no signs of significant human activity, are not fragmented by infrastructure, and are at least 50,000 hectares in size. These data can be used for assessment of forest intactness, alteration and degradation at global and regional scales. More information and data downloads are available from the project website.
